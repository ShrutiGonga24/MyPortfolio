    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm a dedicated and curious student pursuing my Diploma
 in Information Technology at Government Polytechnic,Solapur.
       My interests lie in software development, web technologies, and programming.</p><br>

    <p>
      I have gained hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and database management through projects and coursework.
       I enjoy turning ideas into functional and user-friendly applications.
    </p><br>

    <p>
      Iâ€™m enthusiastic about learning new technologies and collaborating on projects that make a difference. 
      Iâ€™m currently seeking opportunities to grow my skills and 
      contribute to meaningful tech solutions.
    </p><br>

    <h2>ðŸŒ¸ My Artistic Journey</h2>  
    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Shruti â€“ a passionate artist with a love for intricate details and storytelling through patterns. From the delicate flow of mandalas to bold silhouette designs, 
      I turn every blank page into a space for imagination.</p><br>

    <p>Art for me isnâ€™t just a hobby â€” itâ€™s how I speak without words.
Itâ€™s how I bring peace, focus, and meaning into the world
 â€” one line, one pattern,one stroke at a time.</p><br>

<p>I find inspiration in nature, tradition, and everyday emotions, merging them
 into unique compositions that are part meditative, part magical.</p><br>

 <p>Whether itâ€™s pen and ink or a splash of color, I create art that reflects patience, precision, and passion.</p>
